# General. The app must be built with Next.js (the latest stable version) and TypeScript.
## Pages. The app has 2 pages: Posts Page and Create Post Page.
  a. The Posts Page displays a list of posts
  b. The Create Post Page displays a form where users can submit a new post
# Data. The data must be stored in the local storage
# UI. The UI (e.g., paddings, margins, widths, heights, colors) must match the Figma designs
# Linting. The project should have the Lint enabled and the code must be properly formatted (you can use any rules of your preference)
# State management. The app should use Redux to store and retrieve posts (you can use redux toolkit).
# Architecture. The app should be built properly (components, consts, etc.). Imagine, if this app would grow into something bigger, so it should be scalable and easy to maintain.

# UI is provided for the desktop screens only; you can add a mobile version as well (and design that at your own preference)
# You can integrate the Husky pre-commit hook to automate linting / type checks
# You can add some unit tests
# Use Tailwind for the CSS
